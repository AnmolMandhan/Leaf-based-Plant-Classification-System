# 🌿 Plant Classification System using Leaf Images
This project is a Plant Classification System built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify plant species from leaf images. Developed as a **final year project**,  it features a TensorFlow-based model and a Streamlit web app for real-time predictions. Sample images are included for demonstration.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Streamlit
- NumPy, Pandas

---

## 🌱 Features

- Leaf image preprocessing
- CNN model training & prediction
- Upload and classify images via Streamlit
- Real-time prediction demo
- Sample dataset included

## 📂 Dataset
The model was trained on a dataset of 7,000+ leaf images covering multiple plant species.
Due to size and licensing constraints, the full dataset is not included in this repository. However, a few sample images are provided in the sample_images/ folder for testing and demonstration purposes.
