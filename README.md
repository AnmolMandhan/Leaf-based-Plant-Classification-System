# Leaf-based-Plant-Classification-System
This project is a Plant Classification System built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify plant species from leaf images. Developed as a final year project,  it features a TensorFlow-based model and a Streamlit web app for real-time predictions. Sample images are included for demonstration.
