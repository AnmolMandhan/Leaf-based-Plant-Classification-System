# 🌿 Plant Classification System using Leaf Images
This project is a Plant Classification System built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify plant species from leaf images. Developed as a **final year project**,  it features a TensorFlow-based model and a Streamlit web app for real-time predictions. Sample images are included for demonstration.
